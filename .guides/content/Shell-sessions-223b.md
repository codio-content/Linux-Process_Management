## Running multiple _bash_ sessions in a single terminal

So far, we've been using 2 different terminal windows in order to demonstrate 2 similar running processes that do not interrupt each other.

__Shell sessions__ however, allow us to run multiple _bash_ processes __in a single terminal__.

Lets start another instance of the _bash_ program by executing: 

```
codio ~/workspace $ bash
```

The command prompt should switch to something like this: 

```
# @usernames may vary
codio@couple-capital:~/workspace$
```
