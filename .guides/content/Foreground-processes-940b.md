## Process Status

Take a closer look at the _top_ command column labelled with a letter 'S' for _process status_.

Whether you open T1 or T2, you'll notice that one of the `top` command processes is _Sleeping_ while the other is _Running_. 

The _top_ process that is _Running_ is the one of the selected terminal. Whenever you switch from T1 to T2 or the other way around, the _Running_ process becomes the one of that current terminal window.

### It is possible to run multiple _bash_ sessions in a single terminal window
