## Computer processes

Computers are very powerful machines because of their capacity of performing multiple tasks at once at a very high speed.

These tasks require CPU power in order to be completed. 

CPU power as well as other information regarding each of the tasks or processes that a computer is performing is controlled and measured by using _job control_ tools. 

By the end of this unit you will feel comfortable with:

- Executing the `top` command for analyzing computer processes through the CLI
- Identifying background and foreground processes and some of its elements
- Searching for processes by process id number
- Killing processes
